# Cryptocurrency is all the rage. You have decided to create your own,
# KelloggCoin, that will massively disrupt financial markets at the Global
# Hub.

# Don't change the following code, which represents a series of transactions, each
# of which represents a transfer of KelloggCoin from one user to another â€“ transactions 
# with no from_user are from the "ICO" (Initial Coin Offering)

blockchain = [
  { from_user: nil, to_user: "ben", amount: 20000 },
  { from_user: nil, to_user: "brian", amount: 20000 },
  { from_user: "ben", to_user: "evan", amount: 9000 },
  { from_user: "brian", to_user: "anthony", amount: 7000 },
  { from_user: "evan", to_user: "anthony", amount: 400 },
  { from_user: "ben", to_user: "anthony", amount: 1500 },
  { from_user: "anthony", to_user: "ben", amount: 4500 },
  { from_user: "anthony", to_user: "evan", amount: 1750 }
]

# Write code below that returns the number of KelloggCoin that each user has in their 
# KelloggCoin "wallet".

# It should print out:
# Ben's KelloggCoin balance is 14000
# Brian's KelloggCoin balance is 13000
# Evan's KelloggCoin balance is 10350
# Anthony's KelloggCoin balance is 2650

# ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ Your code HERE ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

# Creating new variables for each user for their KelloggCoin balance

# kc_Ben = 0
# kc_Brian = 0
# kc_Evan = 0
# kc_Anthony = 0

puts "#{blockchain[3][:from_user]} #{blockchain[3][:to_user]}"

for send in blockchain
  for received in blockchain
  puts received[:to_user]
